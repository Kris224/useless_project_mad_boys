### Project Description
Our project aims to create a rickshaw-sharing platform that connects individuals traveling to the same destination at similar times, allowing them to team up and share a rickshaw. This solution not only reduces individual travel expenses but also contributes to minimizing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Our platform allows individuals to create a "travel card" with their destination, time, and other relevant details. Other users with similar travel plans can then view and join these cards, forming teams to share a rickshaw. This initiative represents a step towards making urban transportation more affordable, sustainable, and accessible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever feel overwhelmed by the hassle of solo rickshaw rides to common destinations? Are you constantly burdened by the soul-crushing existential dread of... not having anyone to split the fare with on your five-minute journey? Well, you‚Äôre not alone (except, you know, you usually are in the rickshaw). Urban transportation has become a lonely affair, and it‚Äôs high time we put an end to this tragic solo-commuting lifestyle. After all, why have an uneventful, private ride when you could embark on a thrilling rickshaw adventure with a complete stranger? Yes, that‚Äôs the real transportation crisis no one is talking about.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Rickshare‚Äîthe platform that brings people together to plan their rickshaw adventures, leaving the actual rickshaw-hailing to your expert skills. Here‚Äôs how it works: you enter your destination, time, and any fun facts (such as "Will only sit on the left side" or "Brings own background music"), and Rickshare will match you with other eco-conscious adventurers heading the same way.Rickshare handles the logistics of making friends with strangers. Sustainable transport, social connections, and the thrill of the chase‚ÄîRickshare: the ultimate way to almost make rickshaw-sharing easy.
